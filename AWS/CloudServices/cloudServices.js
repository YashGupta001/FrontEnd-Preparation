Three type of services:
1. Infrasturcture as a service
2. Platform as a service
3. Software as a service

1. If any cloud provides you IAAS it means that harware will be own by them and they will also give you an operating system based on your preference and then you will handle the what you need to perform on that OS means you will now manage the other parts

Example of that is EC2 which is IAAS



2. Lets you are a DB admin or Linux admin who has done all the DB setup and make you your data wont lost and provides all the security then you can ask others to use this as they wont know how to make this setup and manage only your data.
This concept is known as PAAS

Example of which is a RDS


3. In this you dont need to manage anything just pay the price and use the services but in this case data will be managed by the cloud provider which sometimes is not good as some company dont want to put their data on cloud hand
