If I have to prepare for #frontenddeveloper #interview today then below would be my preparation strategy.
I would divide my overall interview preparation time into 3 parts.

Part 1: I will begin with solving at least 60 easy, 30 medium and 10 hard problems on #leetcode. I will primarily stick to #arrays , #strings, #stacks , #queue and #linkedlist data structures.

Part 2: Machine coding on both Venilla JS and #reactjs and below would be the problems that I would solve for practice.
-> Tower of hanoi
-> Tic tac toe
-> Snake and ladder
-> Chess game simulation
-> Splitwise kind of web application
-> Rendering a large list with thousands of elements.
-> Building all the security aspects of an application from the client side.
-> Practicing all the basic JS and ReactJS syntax so that I don't have to rely on auto suggestions.

Part 3: Solving tricky #reactjs interview questions. Mostly on building #reactjs specific features. Recently I have seen Prashant Yadav's Learner bucket #youtubechannel having a lot of interesting questions and I would surely check it out for practicing.

Passively I would work on System design (1-2 systems per week). If I can spend 3 hours every day, I should be ready for an interview in a month.
