There are multiple type of client server architecture like 1-tier, 2-tier, 3-tier and n-tier

1 Tier architecture: All the work done in one place


In a single-tier application, the user interface, backend business logic, and the database reside in the same machine. Typical examples of single-tier applications are desktop applications like MS Office, PC Games, image editing software like Gimp, Photoshop, etc.


2 Tier architecture: 

Two-tiered application examples include desktop applications, games, and music players. Advantages: It is fast and easy to implement. communication is faster.

In a two-tier architecture, the client is on the first tier. The database server and web application server reside on the same server machine, which is the second tier. This second tier serves the data and executes the business logic for the web application.


3 Tier architecture:

A 3-tier application architecture is a modular client-server architecture that consists of a presentation tier, an application tier and a data tier.
